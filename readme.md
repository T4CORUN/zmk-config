## [Rollow](https://www.barbellboards.com/product/rollow)

Rollow is one of the first split keyboards with dedicated thumb encoders... It's inspired by the ergonomics of a Ferris and the elegance of a Corne. While also influenced by my passion for the automotive customization scene.

This passion is represented in the small details likeâ€¦

- A base plate designed with hot-swap socket cutouts, allowing sockets to fit within the plate making Rollow one of the lowest sitting hot-swappable split keyboards (Excluding Mini Version).
- Custom Inset OLED covers add additional protection to your OLEDs, while maintaining a balanced, sleek, and flush appearance to your board.
- Gasket-like sound dampening layer to minimize unwanted rattles and noise.

My Notes:

- This is my first time using ZMK
- ZMK does not officially define the Rollow Shield and does not support Peripheral Side Encoder as of 2022-Oct-25
- Uses [infused-kim](https://github.com/infused-kim) repo to enable peripheral side encoder
- Used [tutuuXY](https://github.com/TutuuXY/zmk-config)'s repo to get shield definition
- Things I use that are missing
